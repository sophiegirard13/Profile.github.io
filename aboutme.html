        My name is <strong>Sophie Girard</strong>, I am 22 years old and I have recently graduated from a Bachelor in Design. I followed my studies at the Kedge Design School. I am characterized by my creativity, my intuition and my passion for design. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to successfully complete each project entrusted to me thanks to my sense of organization which allows me to achieve my objectives. I enjoy working in a team, while being autonomous in carrying out my missions.     
        <br>
        <br>

        My studies allowed me to develop my technical skills, but also my sense of aesthetics, ergonomics and project management. I have always had a certain sensitivity towards the environment, which leads me to prioritize the design of products that are respectful of the planet, sustainable and ethical.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the rest of my career, I chose to complete an international master's degree, "MSc Strategic Design Thinking", with the aim of expanding my field of skills. My goal is to merge my design expertise with a strategic approach to solving complex problems and driving innovation. This involves in particular an integration of the areas of management, business strategy and innovation management.
